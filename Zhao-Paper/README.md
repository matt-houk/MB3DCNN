# Attempts to recreate work from Zhao et. al.

Attempts to recreate the results of this paper were largely unsuccessful. As far as we could tell it was identical. Efforts to contact the authors were unsuccessful. This part of the project is being set aside in favor of other options. Any insight to issues in this code would be appreciated.
