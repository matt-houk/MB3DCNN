# Code for adapting the EEGNet model to 3D applications

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/aace8c

This project requires that the DepthwiseConv2D and SeparableConv2D layers must be adapted to 3D. One of the goals as an outcome will be to compile the learnings from this into code that can support the integration of this functionality into tensorflow.
