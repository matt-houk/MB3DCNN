Seeking to recreate the work demonstrated in A Multi-Branch 3D Convolutional Neural Network for EEG-Based Motor Imagery Classification by Xinqiao Zhao , Hongmiao Zhang , Member, IEEE, Guilin Zhu, Fengxiang You, Shaolong Kuang, Member, IEEE, and Lining Sun

DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2938295

# Challenges

Implementation of the model based off the graphic supplied by the paper

Recreate results using the BCI Competition IV dataset

# Updates

As of 5/30/2021, will be updating all contents of repository to reflect most recent efforts.
Expect an update in the following week.

Intend to pursue the implementation of the DepthwiseConv3D Op in TensorFlow using C instead of the Keras API.
